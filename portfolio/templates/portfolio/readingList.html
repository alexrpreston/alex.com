    <p class="readListInfo">I really enjoy reading and I've found that if I share my reading list it helps me stay consistent. I usually take notes on any Non-Fiction book I read and they are viewable at my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/alexrpreston/books">Evernote notebook.</a><br><br>
        I also add every book I read and in my queue to my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108050931-alex">Goodreads account</a>.
